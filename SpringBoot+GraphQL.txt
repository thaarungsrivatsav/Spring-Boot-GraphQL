GraphQL
-it is to make the data transfer happend faster
-to make the API to work faster and efficiently and quickly too
- graphql will return the json object in the format of what we ask from the DB...
- its based on noSQL db (without table , rows and columns)
- for eg:
	there is name , dob , age , salary in an db 
in graphql if we request the object as 
{
 person1{
  name
 }
} 
 my obeject will return values like tis
 {				
  person1{
  "name":"nameval"
  }
 }
and if we want extra value with the objects then we need to call the object as

{
 person1{
  name
  age
 }
 person2{
  dob
  age
 }
} 
 my obeject will return values like tis
 {				
  person1{
  "name":"nameval",
  "age":21
  }
  person1{
  "dob":"12-12-2012",
  "age":21
  }
 }
whenever we want required values we can change the object as required and we will get the values according to that call 
and whatever record from which field we request will be retrived from to nosql db , which has all the set of values and records in an database which will not
be in an table format , as it is nosql it will not be in the format of the table , cols and rows.
